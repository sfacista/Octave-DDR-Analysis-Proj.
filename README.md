# Octave-DDR-Analysis-Proj.
Ignore superfluous files.
This script, which may be incomplete, will run in MATLAB or Octave. The goal is to perform multiple checks pertaining to the analysis of some dose response data. I have included sample data.
The most useful updates will be those that further automate the script so that the only input needed would be the data.
